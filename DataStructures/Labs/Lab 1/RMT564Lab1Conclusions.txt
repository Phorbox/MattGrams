In reversing the bible, I have found the iterative function to be preferable to the recursive one. 
To the point where my recursive function in its current state could not reverse it without a line 
buffer of only 200 or dramatically reducing the length of the bible.  Unless I made one change or 
the other I would get a segmentation fault.  The Iterative function seemed to have a negligible 
time to complete while the recursive one managed to have time.
